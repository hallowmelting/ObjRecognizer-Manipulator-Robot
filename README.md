# Object Recognition 2-Axis Manipulator Factory Indoor Cleaning Robot 

This repository includes all documentation and code related to a Robot Operating System (ROS2) Foxy based cleaning robot. The robot operates on a Raspberry Pi4 running Ubuntu 20.04. 

## Overview
The robot combines real-time object detection and picking functionality using a 2-axis manipulator. It uses a camera to recognize waste in its surroundings in real-time, utilizing the YOLOv8n model for object recognition. This allows it to pick up garbage with high precision and efficiency, contributing to maintaining a clean factory indoor environment. 

## Key Features 

- **Object Recognition:** Real-time object detection using YOLOv8n model through image-based data acquired from a camera. 
- **Manipulator Functionality:** Integrated with a 2-axis manipulator to pick up recognized objects. 
- **Platform:** Runs on Raspberry Pi4 with Ubuntu 20.04. Uses ROS2 Foxy for operation. 

## Getting Started 
To use this robot and understand its structure, one can follow the provided documentation to set up the environment on a Raspberry Pi4. The documentation includes step-by-step instructions for installation, usage, and necessary packages required. 

This project aims to contribute to the enhancement of automated cleaning efforts in factory environments. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome.
